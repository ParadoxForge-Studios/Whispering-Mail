📮 Whispering Mail A cozy postal puzzle adventure — built in 30 days Whispering Mail is a short, atmospheric puzzle-adventure where you play as the mail carrier of a quiet little village. Every day you receive a stack of mysterious letters filled with cryptic hints, symbols, and half-revealed names. Your task is to discover who each letter truly belongs to through conversations, observation, and small puzzles.

🕒 This game was developed as a fully playable 30-day student project, with a strong focus on small scope, mood, and polished core mechanics. No combat. No stress. Just calm exploration, cozy mystery, and gentle storytelling.
